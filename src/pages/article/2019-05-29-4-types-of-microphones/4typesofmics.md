The right mic choice = a better recording. A little mic knowledge can go a long way. Here's the basics anyone working in a studio should know. 

## The 4 Types of Microphones

1. Dynamic Microphones
2. Large Diaphragm Condensers
3. Small Diaphragm Condensers
4. Ribbon Microphones

Here's what you should know about each one.

## Dynamic Microphones

Dynamic mics are usually pretty hardy and can be used on a lot of different sources. They tend to be cheaper, record less details, and can be great for both close micing and micing things at distance. 

If you only have a $100 to buy a microphone and you will be recording more than just vocals, I recommend you get the [Shure SM57](https://amzn.to/2YXSNDk). One of the most versatile and famous mics in the world. A classic for a reason.

### What Are Dynamic Mics Good For?

- Live performances
- Snare drums
- Guitar Cabinets 
- Vocals
- Can be used on pretty much anything

### Great Dynamic Mics
- [Shure SM57](https://amzn.to/2YXSNDk) - $99
- [Shure SM7B](https://amzn.to/30Rc4II) - $399

## Large Diaphragm Condensers

Large Diaphragm Condensers or <strong>LDC</strong> mics are often the best choice to record vocals. They record a lot of detail and nuance but can be fragile and expensive. 

Both Large and Small Diaphragm condensers microphones usually will require their own power source or phantom power from a mic preamp or audio interface.

### What Are LDC Mics Good For?
- Vocals
- Room Mics
- When you want to capture the fine details

### Great Large Diaphragm Condensers

## Small Diaphragm Condensers

Small Diaphragm Condensers also will capture a lot of detail but are used a bit differently than LDCs. Typically you might use a Small Diaphragm condenser to mic a source at a distance of a couple feet or more. They are great for capturing the sound of a room or collection of sounds in fine detail. 

### What Are Small Diaphragm Condensers Good For?
- Room Mics
- Drum Overheads
- Acoustic Guitar (Usually closer)
- Recording Live Vocals (Depending on the particular mic)
- Hi Hat (Close Mic'd)

### Great Small Diaphragm Condensers

- [Rhode NT5 Matched Pair](https://amzn.to/2WrR5g8) - $426

## Ribbon Mics

**Warning** : If you send Phantom Power to a ribbon mic you could destroy it. Something you need to know.

Beyond potentially being destroyed by phantom power the characteristics of a ribbon mic can be thought of as somewhere between a condenser mic and a dynamic mic. They can be great on everything from vocals to drum overheads depending on the particular ribbon mic you are using. 

### What Ribbon Mics are Good For (REALLY Depends on the Mic)
- Guitar Cabinets (Royer R121)
- Drum Overheads (Coles 4038)
- Piano, Strings (Apollo)
- Vocals (Various classic ribbons)
