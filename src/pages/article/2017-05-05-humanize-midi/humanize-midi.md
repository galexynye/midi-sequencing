This is a technique to randomly vary your midi's rhythm and velocities in order to create more human sounding tracks. This concept is an invaluable time saver.

If you are composer who writes in Sibelius or Finale, you can quickly vary your imported midi instead of going through hell to edit every individual part/note. If you are drawing in drum beats you can quickly add interesting variations and human like imperfections.

<strong>Sometimes you just want to see something specific</strong> in the tutorial. No problem. I have time stamped links embedded below to take you right where you want to go.

A lot of little tricks can really speed up the midi editing process. If there are notes within a section that you would like to edit and you have notes that are already selected, you can save a some serious time by displacing notes you've already selected a couple octaves to grab what you want to edit. It makes more sense to watch it.
