Reverb is how we can add dimension and space to a sound or mix. Technically there are 5 different types of Reverb.

1. Natural Reverb
2. Plate Reverb
3. Spring Reverb
4. Digital Reverb
5. Convolution Reverb

## Natural Reverb

Natural reverb is the room noise microphones pic up in a studio. Great concert halls are built so their acoustics will produce a pleasant natural reverb. 

I mostly will record dry (without any reverb) and will simulate the effect of natural reverb with a convolution reverb. We'll get back to that. 

## Plate Reverb 

Plate reverb was the first artificial reverb invented way back in 1957 but it still sounds great today. Plate reverb is literally made with a giant metal plate that is vibrated by an analog signal.

Most of the time when we mix with "plate reverb" sounds today it is with a convolution reverb or digital reverb because having giant metal plates in studios is often unpractical. 

## Spring Reverb 

Spring reverbs work similar to plate reverbs but instead of a metal plate they use a spring. Because spring reverbs are so cheap to make they were built into guitar amps, toys and other places that needed a cheap reverb source before computers were cheap. 

Spring reverbs have a unique sound, much different than the other types of reverbs and can often be a forgotten creative asset when mixing. 

## Digital Reverb

Digital reverbs are created by digitally delaying the sound to give the illusion of a reverb. 

Some of the best sounding reverbs are digital reverbs. Classic models of digital reverb include the EMT250, the Lexicon 224 and the AMS RMX16 (Phil Collins drum sound) reverbs.

## Convolution Reverb

Convolution reverb is like a sampler of reverb. By creating a impulse response of a room, plate, spring or digital reverb you can emulate the sound of that reverb in a convolution reverb. 

Because of this you can get any type of reverb sound with a convolution reverb.
